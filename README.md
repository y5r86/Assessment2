## 🎯 How to Play

- The game is for two players.
- You can add the names of the player.
- Players take turns entering a number from **1 to 9** to place their symbol on the board.
- The board layout is mapped to the number keys as follows:

 1 | 2 | 3
---|---|---
 4 | 5 | 6
---|---|---
 7 | 8 | 9

- The first player to align **three of their symbols** horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
- If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a **draw**.
